## [Homeschool Co-op CRUD App](https://github.com/jackcooperusesvim/Co-op_Project_Summary)
(Link Here)[]
This is a CRUD app I am building for a local homeschool Co-op. It is my first program I ever wrote for the web, and it has gone through several iterations. I have laid them out in order so that you can see how I learn and how I work. I am writing the most recent iteration in Rails, so you can also see how I am getting along with that.

## [Tic-Tac-Toe AI](https://github.com/jackcooperusesvim/tic-tac-toe-AI) - COMPLETE
This is a minimax algorithm I wrote in Go to play Tic-Tac-Toe. This is an algorithm I've loved since I was 15, and I am currently writing another one in Rust to play Mancala. That one will be my first to involve depth-limiting and multithreading. It is also being written as a library more than a application, with a simple API to write your own bots.
